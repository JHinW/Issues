**understand js Inheritance**  
https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-s-the-difference-between-class-prototypal-inheritance-e4cd0a7562e9  

1. Classes inherit from classes and create subclass relationships: hierarchical class taxonomies. 
2. Prototypal Inheritance: A prototype is a working object instance. Objects inherit directly from other objects.

3. Inheritance is fundamentally a code reuse mechanism: A way for different kinds of objects to share code.
