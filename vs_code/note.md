# use vscode to debug nodejs

**use sourceMapPathOverrides if sourceMap is out from webpack2**  
```json
{
    "sourceMapPathOverrides": {
    "webpack:///./*":   "${cwd}/*", // Example: "webpack:///./src/app.js" -> "/users/me/project/src/app.js"
    "webpack:///*":     "*",        // Example: "webpack:///C:/project/app.ts" -> "C:/project/app.ts"
    "meteor://ðŸ’»app/*": "${cwd}/*"  // Example: "meteor://ðŸ’»app/main.ts" -> "c:/code/main.ts"
}
```
